## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development

## Proposed Solution
```
A Smart Crop Advisory System delivered via a mobile app + chatbot with AI/ML capabilities:

Uses location-based weather & soil data for crop planning.

Provides fertilizer/pesticide recommendations based on soil test reports.

Integrates computer vision for pest/disease detection using uploaded images.

Tracks market prices and suggests profitable crop selling opportunities.

Offers voice-based interaction in regional languages for inclusivity.

Provides alerts & notifications (rain, pest outbreaks, government schemes).

Innovation & Uniqueness:

Combines AI, IoT, NLP, and Computer Vision into one farmer-friendly tool.

Supports multilingual and voice-first interaction, unlike existing apps.

Focuses on low-bandwidth & offline functionality for rural areas.
```

## Technical Approach
```
Technologies:

AI/ML for prediction & recommendations

Computer Vision (CNN models) for pest/disease detection

NLP for multilingual chatbot/voice assistance

Cloud + Mobile App frameworks (Flutter/React Native, Firebase, Python backend)

IoT integration (soil sensors, weather stations)

Implementation Methodology:

Data collection (soil, crop, weather, pest images)

AI/ML model training (recommendations & disease detection)

Multilingual chatbot development with NLP

Integration of real-time APIs (weather, market prices)

Mobile app development with voice & offline support

Pilot testing with farmers and feedback loop

```

## Feasibility and Viability
```
Feasibility: Mobile penetration in rural India is above 70%, making it accessible.

Challenges:

Low digital literacy → mitigated via voice/vernacular support.

Poor internet connectivity → addressed with offline-first design.

Farmer trust → build partnerships with NGOs & govt agencies.

Viability: Can be scaled nationally through government schemes (PM-Kisan, Kisan Call Centers).

```

## Impact and Benefits
```
Social: Empowers farmers with knowledge and confidence.

Economic: Increases yield & profitability, reduces input costs.

Environmental: Encourages responsible use of fertilizers/pesticides, improving soil health.

National Level: Enhances food security and reduces dependency on imports.
